Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Fraudulent Claims

## Abstract
Credit card companies are actively trying to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent customer grief for the charges they have not purchased. I predict applying machine learning techniques on credit card transactional data can help prevent fraudulent purchases. To test this hypothesis, data will be imported from a public, non-affiliated credit card company dataset, off Kaggle. Finally, support vector machine ML algorithms will be applied.
